This is an example markdown file highlighting how external blog posts should be submitted into this repo. You will notice there is a little yaml block at the beginning detailing the title and author of the blog post. This paragraph here would be placed immediately after the featured image of the blog post. All blog posts require a featured image. You can provide us one if you own the rights and it fits with the overall blog aesthetic. Alternatively, we will pick one for you. The header below will be the first actual header of the blog post past the feature image. Do note you don't need to write anything between the featured image and the first header if you want!

## This will be the first header users will see in the blog post proper

Avoid using the H1 header (`#`) for any headers in the blog post, as only the title should be H1.

## Here goes the rest of the blog

Much ado about nothing

## Final words

To conclude, this is the end.

## Call to Action (CTA)

We usually end most blogs with a CTA that links back to the [NGINX Community Forum](https://community.nginx.org/). If you have a different blog/platform you want to link to, this would be the place to do it. Keep in mind this is not a spot to do any commercial advertising and we will kindly ask you to remove a CTA that is not community focused.
